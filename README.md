# Timesheet ReLabeler

Ever get tired of your timesheet having nonsensical labels?

10 different projects using the same rate cell as a name?

Typos that make you mad?

If these problems feel familiar to you, then give Timesheet Relabeler a whirl.

Take a look at this radical example!

### Before
![Timesheet Before](https://github.com/hardingalexh/timesheet-relabeler/blob/main/marketing/timesheet_before.png?raw=true)

DATA TOOL? I've got a hundred of those!
TASK9DATATOOL2? Where are the spaces? Show some decorum!

### Preferences
![Configuration](https://github.com/hardingalexh/timesheet-relabeler/blob/main/marketing/relabeler_prefs.png?raw=true)

Simply add your mapping for what you'd like the text to say. Not all projects are cool, but if you label them that way, they may be one day.

### After

Like magic! Your labels are now provided.

## Installation

### Chrome and Arc
Timesheet Re-Labeler is available as a [chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/timesheet-relabeler/mcmhhlbppfmhndjbofacgicknkhfgjmm?hl=en&authuser=0).

### Firefox
A firefox add-on is officially available and signed. From the add-ons management screen (type `about:addons` into your browser), click the settings cog and choose `Install Add-On From File...`. In the menu, select the `timesheet-relabeler-1-0.xpi` file in this repository.

This should be available as an official add-on soon too.

## Usage
Right-click the ReLabeler Icon which looks like this:

![ReLabeler Icon](https://github.com/hardingalexh/timesheet-relabeler/blob/main/images/label-128.png?raw=true)

Depending on your browser, this will bring up an options screen or have you "manage extension" to see its preferences. In the left-hand column, put charge codes. In the right-hand column, put labels.

And next time you go to your timesheet... VOILA! You'll see some labels, if it works.
